#Exercise 1 - Git Bash Basics!#

Alright Den, first exercise!

I want you to show off your git and bash skills with this simple exercise. 

You should **git commit** each step of the process after **step 2**.

1. Checkout **dev**.
2. Create a new branch called **exercise_1** from dev.
3. Create 2 new directories inside of this one called **exercise-1** and one called **misc**.
4. Create new files: **start.js**, **styles.css**, **misc.txt** and **index.html**.
5. Move those files into the **exercise-1** directory from this directory.
6. Rename **start.js** to **index.js**.
7. Delete the **misc** directory.
8. Delete **misc.txt**.
9. Copy **exercise-1** and into a new directory called **exercise-2** and move it to the outer directory called **exercise-2-basic-javascript**. Bonus points if you can tell me how to do it in one command.

**Push** your branch to **GitHub** and make a **pull request** to merge to dev.

Have Fun!
